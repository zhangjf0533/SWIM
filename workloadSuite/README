To reduce confusion, we have consolidated the SWIM git hub
wiki as the sole documentation source. 

Full documentation see https://github.com/SWIMProjectUCB/SWIM/wiki.

In order to simulate periods of read-intensive workloads, we have modified the original FB-2010_samples_24_times_1hr_0.tsv file. The modified file is named 2010_samples_24_times_modified.tsv.
